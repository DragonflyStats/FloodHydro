  lasso Set up a lasso prior in brms
  #### Description 
  Function used to set up a lasso prior for population-level effects in brms. The function does not
  evaluate its #### Arguments â€“ it exists purely to help set up the model.
  Usage
  lasso(df = 1, scale = 1)
  #### Arguments
  df Degrees of freedom of the chi-square prior of the inverse tuning parameter. Defaults
  to 1.
  scale Scale of the lasso prior. Defaults to 1.
  #### Details
  The lasso prior is the Bayesian equivalent to the LASSO method for performing variable selection
  (Park & Casella, 2008). With this prior, independent Laplace (i.e. double exponential) priors are
  placed on the population-level effects. The scale of the Laplace priors depends on a tuning parameter
  that controls the amount of shrinkage. In brms, the inverse of the tuning parameter is used
  so that smaller #### Values imply more shrinkage. The inverse tuning parameter has a chi-square distribution
  and with degrees of freedom controlled via argument df of function lasso (defaults to
                                                                            1). For instance, one can specify a lasso prior using set_prior("lasso(1)"). To make sure that
  shrinkage can equally affect all coefficients, predictors should be one the same scale. If you do not
  want to standardized all variables, you can adjust the general scale of the lasso prior via argument
  scale, for instance, lasso(1, scale = 10).
