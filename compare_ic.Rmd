## ``compare_ic`` 

Compare Information Criteria of Different Models
#### Description 
Compare information criteria of different models fitted with WAIC or loo.

#### Usage

<pre><code>
compare_ic(..., x = NULL, ic = c("loo", "waic", "kfold"))
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
... At least two objects returned by WAIC or loo. Alternatively, brmsfit objects
with information criteria precomputed via add_ic may be passed, as well.
x A list containing the same types of objects as can be passed via ....
ic The name of the information criterion to be extracted from brmsfit objects.
Ignored if information criterion objects are only passed directly.


#### Examples
```{r}
## Not run:
# model with population-level effects only
fit1 <- brm(rating ~ treat + period + carry,
data = inhaler, family = "gaussian")
waic1 <- WAIC(fit1)
# model with an additional varying intercept for subjects
fit2 <- brm(rating ~ treat + period + carry + (1|subject),
data = inhaler, family = "gaussian")
waic2 <- WAIC(fit2)
# compare both models
compare_ic(waic1, waic2)
## End(Not run)
```

#### Details
for more details see compare.
#### Value
An object of class iclist.
