## ``Extract Data and Posterior Draws``

#### Description 
This method helps in preparing brms models for certin post-processing tasks most notably various forms of predictions. Unless you are a package developer, you will rarely need to call extract_draws directly.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
## S3 method for class 'brmsfit'
extract_draws(x, newdata = NULL, re_formula = NULL, allow_new_levels = FALSE, sample_new_levels = "uncertainty", incl_autocor = TRUE, resp = NULL, nsamples = NULL, subset = NULL, nug = NULL, smooths_only = FALSE, offset = TRUE, new_objects = list(), ...)
extract_draws(x, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

* ``x``: An R object typically of class 'brmsfit'.
* ``newdata``: An optional data.frame for which to evaluate predictions. If NULL (default), the original data of the model is used.
* ``re_formula``: formula containing group-level effects to be considered in the prediction. If NULL (default), include all group-level effects; if NA, include no group-level effects.
* ``allow_new_levels``: A flag indicating if new levels of group-level effects are allowed (defaults to FALSE). Only relevant if newdata is provided.
* ``sample_new_levels``: Indicates how to sample new levels for grouping factors specified in re_formula.
This argument is only relevant if newdata is provided and allow_new_levels is set to TRUE. If "uncertainty" (default), include group-level uncertainty in the predictions based on the variation of the existing levels. If "gaussian", sample new levels from the (multivariate) normal distribution implied by the group-level standard deviations and correlations. This options may be useful for conducting Bayesian power analysis. If "``old_levels``", directly sample new levels from the existing levels.
* ``incl_autocor``: A flag indicating if ARMA autocorrelation parameters should be included in the predictions. Defaults to TRUE. Setting it to FALSE will not affect other correlation structures such as cor_bsts, or cor_fixed.
* `` resp``: Optional names of response variables. If specified, predictions are performed only for the specified response variables.
* ``nsamples``: Positive integer indicating how many posterior samples should be used. If NULL (the default) all samples are used. Ignored if subset is not NULL.
* subset: A numeric vector specifying the posterior samples to be used. If NULL (the default), all samples are used.
* nug:  Small positive number for Gaussian process terms only. For numerical reasons, the covariance matrix of a Gaussian process might not be positive definite. Adding a very small number to the matrixâ€™s diagonal often solves this problem. If NULL (the default), nug is chosen internally.
* ``smooths_only``: Logical; If TRUE only draws related to the computation of smooth terms will be extracted.
* ``offset``: Logical; Indicates if offsets should be included in the predictions. Defaults to TRUE.
* new_objects A named list of objects containing new data, which cannot be passed via argument newdata. Currently, only required for objects passed to cor_sar and cor_fixed.
* `` ... ``: Further arguments passed to validate_newdata.

#### Value

An object of class 'brmsdraws' or 'mvbrmsdraws', depending on whether a univariate or multivariate
model is passed.
