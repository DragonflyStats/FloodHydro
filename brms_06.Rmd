cor_fixed Fixed user-defined covariance matrices
#### Description 
Define a fixed covariance matrix of the response variable for instance to model multivariate effect
sizes in meta-analysis.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
cor_fixed(V)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
V Known covariance matrix of the response variable. If a vector is passed, it will
be used as diagonal entries (variances) and covariances will be set to zero.
50 cor_ma
#### Value
An object of class cor_fixed.
Examples
## Not run:
dat <- data.frame(y = rnorm(3))
V <- cbind(c(0.5, 0.3, 0.2), c(0.3, 1, 0.1), c(0.2, 0.1, 0.2))
fit <- brm(y~1, data = dat, autocor = cor_fixed(V))
## End(Not run)
cor_ma MA(q) correlation structure
#### Description 
This function is a constructor for the cor_arma class, allowing for moving average terms only.
Usage

<pre><code>
cor_ma(formula = ~1, q = 1, cov = FALSE)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* formula A one sided formula of the form ~ t, or ~ t | g, specifying a time covariate
t and, optionally, a grouping factor g. A covariate for this correlation structure
must be integer #### Valued. When a grouping factor is present in formula, the
correlation structure is assumed to apply only to observations within the same
grouping level; observations with different grouping levels are assumed to be
uncorrelated. Defaults to ~ 1, which corresponds to using the order of the
observations in the data as a covariate, and no groups.
* q A non-negative integer specifying the moving average (MA) order of the ARMA
structure. Default is 1.
cov A flag indicating whether ARMA effects should be estimated by means of residual
covariance matrices (currently only possible for stationary ARMA effects of
order 1). If FALSE (the default) a regression formulation is used that is considerably
faster and allows for ARMA effects of order higher than 1 but cannot
handle user defined standard errors.
#### Value
An object of class cor_arma containing solely moving average terms.

cor_sar Spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) structures
#### Description 
These functions are constructors for the cor_sar class implementing spatial simultaneous autoregressive
structures. The lagsar structure implements SAR of the response values:
y = Wy +  + e
The errorsar structure implements SAR of the residuals:
y =  + u; u = Wu + e
In the above equations,  is the predictor term and e are independent normally or t-distributed
residuals.
Usage
cor_sar(W, type = c("lag", "error"))
cor_lagsar(W)
cor_errorsar(W)
#### Arguments
W An object specifying the spatial weighting matrix. Can be either the spatial
weight matrix itself or an object of class listw or nb, from which the spatial
weighting matrix can be computed.
type Type of the SAR structure. Either "lag" (for SAR of the response #### Values) or
"error" (for SAR of the residuals).
#### Details
Currently, only families gaussian and student support SAR structures.
#### Value
An object of class cor_sar to be used in calls to brm.

Examples
## Not run:
data(oldcol, package = "spdep")
fit1 <- brm(CRIME ~ INC + HOVAL, data = COL.OLD,
autocor = cor_lagsar(COL.nb),
chains = 2, cores = 2)
summary(fit1)
plot(fit1)
fit2 <- brm(CRIME ~ INC + HOVAL, data = COL.OLD,
autocor = cor_errorsar(COL.nb),
chains = 2, cores = 2)
summary(fit2)

cs Category Specific Predictors in brms Models

#### Description 
Category Specific Predictors in brms Models
Usage
cs(expr)
#### Arguments
expr Expression containing predictors, for which category specific effects should be
estimated. For evaluation, R formula syntax is applied.
#### Details
For detailed documentation see help(brmsformula) as well as vignette("brms_overview").
This function is almost solely useful when called in formulas passed to the brms package.

Examples
## Not run:
fit <- brm(rating ~ period + carry + cs(treat),
data = inhaler, family = sratio("cloglog"),
prior = set_prior("normal(0,5)"), chains = 2)
summary(fit)
plot(fit, ask = FALSE)

density_ratio Compute Density Ratios
#### Description 
Compute the ratio of two densities at given points based on samples of the corresponding distributions.
Usage
density_ratio(x, y = NULL, point = 0, n = 4096, ...)
#### Arguments
x Vector of samples from the first distribution, usually the posterior distribution of
the quantity of interest.
y Optional vector of samples from the second distribution, usually the prior distribution
of the quantity of interest. If NULL (the default), only the density of x will
be evaluated.
point Numeric #### Values at which to evaluate and compare the densities. Defaults to 0.
n Single numeric #### Value. Influences the accuracy of the density estimation. See
density for #### Details.
* `` ... ``: Further arguments passed to density.
#### Details
In order to achieve sufficient accuracy in the density estimation, more samples than usual are required.
That is you may need an effective sample size of 10,000 or more to reliably estimate the
densities.
56 epilepsy
#### Value
A vector of length equal to length(point). If y is provided, the density ratio of x against y is
returned. Else, only the density of x is returned.
Examples
x <- rnorm(10000)
y <- rnorm(10000, mean = 1)
density_ratio(x, y, point = c(0, 1))
