brmsfamily Special Family Functions for brms Models
#### Description 
Family objects provide a convenient way to specify the #### Details of the models used by many model
fitting functions. The family functions presented here are for use with brms only and will **not**
work with other model fitting functions such as glm or glmer. However, the standard family functions
as described in family will work with brms. You can also specify custom families for use in
brms with the custom_family function.

#### Details

Family gaussian with identity link leads to linear regression. Family student with identity
link leads to robust linear regression that is less influenced by outliers. Family skew_normal can
handle skewed responses in linear regression. Families poisson, negbinomial, and geometric
with log link lead to regression models for count data. Families binomial and bernoulli with
logit link leads to logistic regression and family categorical to multi-logistic regression when
there are more than two possible outcomes. Families cumulative, cratio (’continuation ratio’),
sratio (’stopping ratio’), and acat (’adjacent category’) leads to ordinal regression. Families
Gamma, weibull, exponential, lognormal, frechet, and inverse.gaussian can be used (among
others) for survival regression. Families weibull, frechet, and gen_extreme_#### Value (’generalized
extreme #### Value’) allow for modeling extremes. Family asym_laplace allows for quantile regression
when fixing the auxiliary quantile parameter to the quantile of interest. Family exgaussian
(’exponentially modified Gaussian’) and shifted_lognormal are especially suited to model reaction
times. The wiener family provides an implementation of the Wiener diffusion model.
For this family, the main formula predicts the drift parameter ’delta’ and all other parameters
are modeled as auxiliary parameters (see brmsformula for #### Details). Families hurdle_poisson,
hurdle_negbinomial, hurdle_gamma, hurdle_lognormal, zero_inflated_poisson, zero_inflated_negbinomial,
zero_inflated_binomial, zero_inflated_beta, and zero_one_inflated_beta allow to estimate
zero-inflated and hurdle models. These models can be very helpful when there are many zeros
in the data (or ones in case of one-inflated models) that cannot be explained by the primary distribution
of the response. Families hurdle_lognormal and hurdle_gamma are especially useful, as
traditional lognormal or Gamma models cannot be reasonably fitted for data containing zeros in the
response.
In the following, we list all possible links for each family. The families gaussian, student,
skew_normal, exgaussian, asym_laplace, and gen_extreme_#### Value accept the links (as names)
identity, log, and inverse; families poisson, negbinomial, geometric, zero_inflated_poisson,
zero_inflated_negbinomial, hurdle_poisson, and hurdle_negbinomial the links log, identity, and sqrt; families binomial, bernoulli, Beta, zero_inflated_binomial, zero_inflated_beta,and zero_one_inflated_beta the links logit, probit, probit_approx, cloglog, cauchit, and
identity; families cumulative, cratio, sratio, and acat the links logit, probit, probit_approx,
cloglog, and cauchit; family categorical the link logit; families Gamma, weibull, exponential, frechet, and hurdle_gamma the links log, identity, and inverse; families lognormal and hurdle_lognormal the links identity and inverse; family inverse.gaussian the links 1/mu^2,
inverse, identity and log; family von_mises the link tan_half; family wiener the link identity.
The first link mentioned for each family is the default.
Please note that when calling the Gamma family function, the default link will be inverse not log.
Also, the probit_approx link cannot be used when calling the binomial family function.
The current implementation of inverse.gaussian models has some convergence problems and requires carefully chosen prior distributions to work efficiently. For this reason, we currently do not recommend to use the inverse.gaussian family, unless you really feel that your data requires exactly this type of model.

... Additional formula objects to specify predictors of non-linear and distributional
parameters. Formulas can either be named directly or contain names
on their left-hand side. The following are distributional parameters of specific

removing the intercept by adding 0 to the right-hand of model formulas. Defaults
to TRUE to mirror the behavior of standard R formula parsing.
#### Details
General formula structure
The formula argument accepts formulas of the following syntax:
response | aterms ~ pterms + (gterms | group)
The pterms part contains effects that are assumed to be the same across observations. We call them
’population-level’ effects or (adopting frequentist vocabulary) ’fixed’ effects. The optional gterms
part may contain effects that are assumed to vary across grouping variables specified in group. We
28 brmsformula
call them ’group-level’ effects or (adopting frequentist vocabulary) ’random’ effects, although the
latter name is misleading in a Bayesian context. for more details type vignette("brms_overview")
and vignette("brms_multilevel").
Group-level terms
Multiple grouping factors each with multiple group-level effects are possible. (Of course we can
also run models without any group-level effects.) Instead of | you may use || in grouping terms to
prevent correlations from being modeled. Alternatively, it is possible to model different group-level terms of the same grouping factor as correlated (even across different formulas, e.g., in non-linear models) by using |<ID>| instead of |. All group-level terms sharing the same ID will be modeled
as correlated. If, for instance, one specifies the terms (1+x|2|g) and (1+z|2|g) somewhere in the formulas passed to brmsformula, correlations between the corresponding group-level effects will be estimated.
If levels of the grouping factor belong to different sub-populations, it may be reasonable to assume
a different covariance matrix for each of the sub-populations. For instance, the variation within the
treatment group and within the control group in a randomized control trial might differ. Suppose
that y is the outcome, and x is the factor indicating the treatment and control group. Then, we
could estimate different hyper-parameters of the varying effects (in this case a varying intercept) for
treatment and control group via y ~ x + (1 | gr(subject, by = x)).
You can specify multi-membership terms using the mm function. For instance, a multi-membership
term with two members could be (1 | mm(g1, g2)), where g1 and g2 specify the first and second
member, respectively. Moreover, if a covariate x varies across the levels of the grouping-factors g1
and g2, we can save the respective covariate #### Values in the variables x1 and x2 and then model the
varying effect as (1 + mmc(x1, x2) | mm(g1, g2)).
Special predictor terms
Smoothing terms can modeled using the s and t2 functions in the pterms part of the model formula.
This allows to fit generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) with brms. The implementation is
similar to that used in the gamm4 package. for more details on this model class see gam and gamm.
Gaussian process terms can be fitted using the gp function in the pterms part of the model formula.
Similar to smooth terms, Gaussian processes can be used to model complex non-linear relationships,
for instance temporal or spatial autocorrelation. However, they are computationally demanding and
are thus not recommended for very large datasets.
The pterms and gterms parts may contain four non-standard effect types namely monotonic, measurement
error, missing #### Value, and category specific effects, which can be specified using terms of
the form mo(predictor), me(predictor, sd_predictor), mi(predictor), and cs(<predictors>),
respectively. Category specific effects can only be estimated in ordinal models and are explained
in more detail in the package’s main vignette (type vignette("brms_overview")). The other thee
effect types are explained in the following.
A monotonic predictor must either be integer #### Valued or an ordered factor, which is the first difference
to an ordinary continuous predictor. More importantly, predictor categories (or integers)
are not assumed to be equidistant with respect to their effect on the response variable. Instead,
the distance between adjacent predictor categories (or integers) is estimated from the data and may
vary across categories. This is realized by parameterizing as follows: One parameter takes care of
the direction and size of the effect similar to an ordinary regression parameter, while an additional
parameter vector estimates the normalized distances between consecutive predictor categories. A
main application of monotonic effects are ordinal predictors that can this way be modeled without
brmsformula 29
(falsely) treating them as continuous or as unordered categorical predictors. for more details and
examples see vignette("brms_monotonic").
  
Quite often, predictors are measured and as such naturally contain measurement error. Although
most researchers are well aware of this problem, measurement error in predictors is ignored in
most regression analyses, possibly because only few packages allow for modeling it. Notably, measurement
error can be handled in structural equation models, but many more general regression models (such as those featured by brms) cannot be transferred to the SEM framework. In brms,
effects of noise-free predictors can be modeled using the me (for ’measurement error’) function.
If, say, y is the response variable and x is a measured predictor with known measurement error sdx, we can simply include it on the right-hand side of the model formula via y ~ me(x, sdx). This can easily be extended to more general formulas. If x2 is another measured predictor with corresponding error sdx2 and z is a predictor without error (e.g., an experimental setting), we
can model all main effects and interactions of the three predictors in the well known manner:
y ~ me(x, sdx) * me(x2, sdx2) * z. In future version of brms, a vignette will be added
to explain moredetails about these so called ’error-in-variables’ models and provide real world
examples.
When a variable contains missing #### Values, the corresponding rows will be excluded from the data by
default (row-wise exclusion). However, quite often we want to keep these rows and instead estimate
the missing #### Values. There are two approaches for this: (a) Impute missing #### Values before the model
fitting for instance via multiple imputation (see brm_multiple for a way to handle multiple imputed
datasets). (b) Impute missing #### Values on the fly during model fitting. The latter approach is explained in the following. Using a variable with missing #### Values as predictors requires two things, First, we
need to specify that the predictor contains missings that should to be imputed. If, say, y is the
primary response, x is a predictor with missings and z is a predictor without missings, we go for
y ~ mi(x) + z. Second, we need to model x as an additional response with corresponding
predictors and the addition term mi(). In our example, we could write x | mi() ~ z. See mi for
examples with real data.

#### Additional response information
Another special of the brms formula syntax is the optional aterms part, which may contain multiple
terms of the form fun(<variable>) separated by + each providing special information on the
response variable. fun can be replaced with either se, weights, cens, trunc, trials, cat, or dec.
Their meanings are explained below. (see also addition-terms).
For families gaussian, student and skew_normal, it is possible to specify standard errors of
the observations, thus allowing to perform meta-analysis. Suppose that the variable yi contains
the effect sizes from the studies and sei the corresponding standard errors. Then, fixed and
random effects meta-analyses can be conducted using the formulas yi | se(sei) ~ 1 and
yi | se(sei) ~ 1 + (1|study), respectively, where study is a variable uniquely identifying every
study. If desired, meta-regression can be performed via yi | se(sei) ~ 1 + mod1 + mod2 + (1|study)
or
yi | se(sei) ~ 1 + mod1 + mod2 + (1 + mod1 + mod2|study), where mod1 and mod2
represent moderator variables. By default, the standard errors replace the parameter sigma. To
model sigma in addition to the known standard errors, set argument sigma in function se to TRUE,
for instance, yi | se(sei, sigma = TRUE) ~ 1.
For all families, weighted regression may be performed using weights in the aterms part. Internally,
this is implemented by multiplying the log-posterior #### Values of each observation by their
corresponding weights. Suppose that variable wei contains the weights and that yi is the response
variable. Then, formula yi | weights(wei) ~ predictors implements a weighted regression.
30 brmsformula
With the exception of categorical, ordinal, and mixture families, left, right, and interval censoring
can be modeled through y | cens(censored) ~ predictors. The censoring variable (named
censored in this example) should contain the #### Values 'left', 'none', 'right', and 'interval'
(or equivalently -1, 0, 1, and 2) to indicate that the corresponding observation is left censored, not
censored, right censored, or interval censored. For interval censored data, a second variable (let’s
call it y2) has to be passed to cens. In this case, the formula has the structure y | cens(censored, y2) ~ predictors.
While the lower bounds are given in y, the upper bounds are given in y2 for interval censored data.
Intervals are assumed to be open on the left and closed on the right: (y, y2].
With the exception of categorical, ordinal, and mixture families, the response distribution can be
truncated using the trunc function in the addition part. If the response variable is truncated between,
say, 0 and 100, we can specify this via yi | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ predictors.
Instead of numbers, variables in the data set can also be passed allowing for varying truncation
points across observations. Defining only one of the two #### Arguments in trunc leads to one-sided
truncation.
  
For all continuous families, missing #### Values in the responses can be imputed within Stan by using the addition term mi. This is mostly useful in combination with mi predictor terms as explained above under ’Special predictor terms’.
For families binomial and zero_inflated_binomial, addition should contain a variable indicating
the number of trials underlying each observation. In lme4 syntax, we may write for instance
cbind(success, n - success), which is equivalent to success | trials(n) in brms
syntax. If the number of trials is constant across all observations, say 10, we may also write
success | trials(10). Please note that the cbind() syntax will not work in brms in the
expected way because this syntax is resevered for use in multivariate models, only.
For all ordinal families, aterms may contain a term cat(number) to specify the number categories
(e.g, cat(7)). If not given, the number of categories is calculated from the data.
In Wiener diffusion models (family wiener) the addition term dec is mandatory to specify the
(vector of) binary decisions corresponding to the reaction times. Non-zero #### Values will be treated as
a response on the upper boundary of the diffusion process and zeros will be treated as a response
on the lower boundary. Alternatively, the variable passed to dec might also be a character vector
consisting of 'lower' and 'upper'.
Multiple addition terms may be specified at the same time using the + operator, for instance
formula = yi | se(sei) + cens(censored) ~ 1 for a censored meta-analytic model.
The addition argument disp (short for dispersion) has been removed in version 2.0. You may instead
use the distributional regression approach by specifying sigma ~ 1 + offset(log(xdisp))
or shape ~ 1 + offset(log(xdisp)), where xdisp is the variable being previously passed to
disp.

#### Parameterization of the population-level intercept
The population-level intercept (if incorporated) is estimated separately and not as part of populationlevel
parameter vector b. As a result, priors on the intercept also have to be specified separately. Furthermore,
to increase sampling efficiency, the population-level design matrix X is centered around its
column means X_means if the intercept is incorporated. This leads to a temporary bias in the intercept
equal to <X_means, b>, where <,> is the scalar product. The bias is corrected after fitting the
model, but be aware that you are effectively defining a prior on the intercept of the centered design
matrix not on the real intercept. for more details on setting priors on population-level intercepts,
see set_prior.
This behavior can be avoided by using the reserved (and internally generated) variable intercept.
Instead of y ~ x, you may write y ~ 0 + intercept + x. This way, priors can be defined on
the real intercept, directly. In addition, the intercept is just treated as an ordinary population-level
effect and thus priors defined on b will also apply to it. Note that this parameterization may be less
efficient than the default parameterization discussed above.

#### Formula syntax for non-linear models

In brms, it is possible to specify non-linear models of arbitrary complexity. The non-linear model
can just be specified within the formula argument. Suppose, that we want to predict the response
y through the predictor x, where x is linked to y through y = alpha - beta * lambda^x,
with parameters alpha, beta, and lambda. This is certainly a non-linear model being defined
via formula = y ~ alpha - beta * lambda^x (addition #### Arguments can be added in the
same way as for ordinary formulas). To tell brms that this is a non-linear model, we set argument
nl to TRUE. Now we have to specify a model for each of the non-linear parameters. Let’s
say we just want to estimate those three parameters with no further covariates or random effects.
Then we can pass alpha + beta + lambda ~ 1 or equivalently (and more flexible)
alpha ~ 1, beta ~ 1, lambda ~ 1 to the ... argument. This can, of course, be extended.
If we have another predictor z and observations nested within the grouping factor g, we may write
for instance alpha ~ 1, beta ~ 1 + z + (1|g), lambda ~ 1. The formula syntax described
above applies here as well. In this example, we are using z and g only for the prediction of beta,
but we might also use them for the other non-linear parameters (provided that the resulting model
is still scientifically reasonable).
Non-linear models may not be uniquely identified and / or show bad convergence. For this reason
it is mandatory to specify priors on the non-linear parameters. For instructions on how to do that,
see set_prior. For some examples of non-linear models, see vignette("brms_nonlinear").
Formula syntax for predicting distributional parameters
It is also possible to predict parameters of the response distribution such as the residual standard
deviation sigma in gaussian models or the hurdle probability hu in hurdle models. The syntax
closely resembles that of a non-linear parameter, for instance sigma ~ x + s(z) + (1+x|g). For
some examples of distributional models, see vignette("brms_distreg").
Alternatively, one may fix distributional parameters to certain values. However, this is mainly useful
when models become too complicated and otherwise have convergence issues. We thus suggest to
be generally careful when making use of this option. The quantile parameter of the asym_laplace
distribution is a good example where it is useful. By fixing quantile, one can perform quantile
regression for the specified quantile. For instance, quantile = 0.25 allows predicting the 25%-
quantile. Furthermore, the bias parameter in drift-diffusion models, is assumed to be 0.5 (i.e. no
bias) in many applications. To achieve this, simply write bias = 0.5. Other possible applications
are the Cauchy distribution as a special case of the Student-t distribution with nu = 1, or the
geometric distribution as a special case of the negative binomial distribution with shape = 1.
Furthermore, the parameter disc (’discrimination’) in ordinal models is fixed to 1 by default and
not estimated, but may be modeled as any other distributional parameter if desired (see examples).
For reasons of identification, 'disc' can only be positive, which is achieved by applying the loglink.
In categorical models, distributional parameters do not have fixed names. Instead, they are named
after the response categories (excluding the first one, which serves as the reference category), with
the prefix 'mu'. If, for instance, categories are named cat1, cat2, and cat3, the distributional
parameters will be named mucat2 and mucat3.

Some distributional parameters currently supported by brmsformula have to be positive (a negative
standard deviation or precision parameter does not make any sense) or are bounded between 0 and
1 (for zero-inflated / hurdle probabilities, quantiles, or the initial bias parameter of drift-diffusion
models). However, linear predictors can be positive or negative, and thus the log link (for positive
parameters) or logit link (for probability parameters) are used by default to ensure that distributional
parameters are within their valid intervals. This implies that, by default, effects for such distributional
parameters are estimated on the log / logit scale and one has to apply the inverse link function
to get to the effects on the original scale. Alternatively, it is possible to use the identity link to
predict parameters on their original scale, directly. However, this is much more likely to lead to
problems in the model fitting, if the parameter actually has a restricted range.
See also brmsfamily for an overview of valid link functions.

#### Formula syntax for mixture models
The specification of mixture models closely resembles that of non-mixture models. If not specified
otherwise (see below), all mean parameters of the mixture components are predicted using the righthand
side of formula. All types of predictor terms allowed in non-mixture models are allowed in
mixture models as well.
distributional parameters of mixture distributions have the same name as those of the corresponding
ordinary distributions, but with a number at the end to indicate the mixture component. For instance,
if you use family mixture(gaussian, gaussian), the distributional parameters are sigma1 and
sigma2. distributional parameters of the same class can be fixed to the same #### Value. For the above
example, we could write sigma2 = "sigma1" to make sure that both components have the same
residual standard deviation, which is in turn estimated from the data.
In addition, there are two types of special distributional parameters. The first are named mu<ID>, that
allow for modeling different predictors for the mean parameters of different mixture components.
For instance, if you want to predict the mean of the first component using predictor x and the mean
of the second component using predictor z, you can write mu1 ~ x as well as mu2 ~ z. The
second are named theta<ID>, which constitute the mixing proportions. If the mixing proportions
are fixed to certain #### Values, they are internally normalized to form a probability vector. If one seeks
to predict the mixing proportions, all but one of the them has to be predicted, while the remaining
one is used as the reference category to identify the model. The softmax function is applied on the
linear predictor terms to form a probability vector.
For more information on mixture models, see the documentation of mixture.
Formula syntax for multivariate models
Multivariate models may be specified using cbind notation or with help of the mvbf function. Suppose
that y1 and y2 are response variables and x is a predictor. Then cbind(y1, y2) ~ x specifies
a multivariate model, The effects of all terms specified at the RHS of the formula are assumed to
vary across response variables. For instance, two parameters will be estimated for x, one for the
effect on y1 and another for the effect on y2. This is also true for group-level effects. When writing,
for instance, cbind(y1, y2) ~ x + (1+x|g), group-level effects will be estimated separately
for each response. To model these effects as correlated across responses, use the ID syntax (see
above). For the present example, this would look as follows: cbind(y1, y2) ~ x + (1+x|2|g).
Of course, you could also use any #### Value other than 2 as ID.
It is also possible to specify different formulas for different responses. If, for instance, y1 should
be predicted by x and y2 should be predicted by z, we could write mvbf(y1 ~ x, y2 ~ z).
Alternatively, multiple brmsformula objects can be added to specify a joint multivariate model (see
’Examples’).
brmsformula 33

An object of class brmsformula, which is essentially a list containing all model formulas as well
as some additional information.
