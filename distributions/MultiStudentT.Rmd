MultiStudentT The Multivariate Student-t Distribution
#### Description 
Density function and random generation for the multivariate Student-t distribution with location
vector mu, covariance matrix Sigma, and degrees of freedom df.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
dmulti_student_t(x, df, mu, Sigma, log = FALSE, check = FALSE)
rmulti_student_t(n, df, mu, Sigma, check = FALSE)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

* ``x``: Vector or matrix of quantiles. If x is a matrix, each row is taken to be a quantile.
* ``df``: Vector of degrees of freedom.
* `` mu ``:Location vector with length equal to the number of dimensions.
* Sigma Covariance matrix.
* log Logical; If TRUE,values are returned on the log scale.
* check Logical; Indicates whether several input checks should be performed. Defaults to FALSE to improve efficiency.
* n Number of samples to draw from the distribution.
