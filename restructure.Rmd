 Restructure Old brmsfit Objects

#### Description 

Restructure old brmsfit objects to work with the latest brms version. This function is called internally when applying post-processing methods. However, in order to avoid unnecessary run time caused by the restructuring, I recommend explicitly calling restructure once per model after updating brms.

#### Usage

<pre><code>
restructure(x, rstr_summary = FALSE)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

* ``x``: An object of class brmsfit.
* rstr_summary Logical; If TRUE, the cached summary stored by rstan is restructured as well.

#### Value
A brmsfit object compatible with the latest version of brms.
