loo.brmsfit Compute the LOO information criterion
#### Description 
Perform approximate leave-one-out cross-validation based on the posterior likelihood using the loo
package. for more details see loo.
Usage
<pre><code>
## S3 method for class 'brmsfit'
loo(x, ..., compare = TRUE, resp = NULL,
pointwise = FALSE, reloo = FALSE, k_threshold = 0.7,
reloo_args = list(), model_names = NULL)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
x A fitted model object.
... More fitted model objects or further #### Arguments passed to the underlying postprocessing
functions.
* ``compare``: A flag indicating if the information criteria of the models should be compared to each other via compare_ic.
* `` resp``: Optional names of response variables. If specified, predictions are performed
only for the specified response variables.
* pointwise A flag indicating whether to compute the full log-likelihood matrix at once or
separately for each observation. The latter approach is usually considerably slower but requires much less working memory. Accordingly, if one runs into
memory issues, pointwise = TRUE is the way to go.
* reloo Logical; Indicate whether reloo should be applied on problematic observations.
Defaults to FALSE.
* k_threshold The threshold at which pareto k estimates are treated as problematic. Defaults to 0.7. Only used if argument reloo is TRUE. See pareto_k_ids for more details.
* reloo_args Optional list of additional arguments passed to reloo.
model_names If NULL (the default) will use model names derived from deparsing the call. Otherwise
will use the passed #### Values as model names.
loo.brmsfit 89
#### Details
When comparing models fitted to the same data, the smaller the LOO, the better the fit. For brmsfit
objects, LOO is an alias of loo. Use method add_ic to store information criteria in the fitted model
object for later usage.
#### Value
If just one object is provided, an object of class ic. If multiple objects are provided, an object of
class iclist.

functions.

fit1 <- brm(rating ~ treat + period + carry,
data = inhaler, family = "gaussian")

loo_predict.brmsfit 91
loo_predict.brmsfit Compute Weighted Expectations Using LOO
#### Description 
These functions are wrappers around the E_loo function of the loo package.
Usage
## S3 method for class 'brmsfit'
loo_predict(object, type = c("mean", "var",
"quantile"), probs = 0.5, psis_object = NULL, resp = NULL, ...)
## S3 method for class 'brmsfit'
loo_linpred(object, type = c("mean", "var",
"quantile"), probs = 0.5, psis_object = NULL, resp = NULL,
scale = "linear", ...)
## S3 method for class 'brmsfit'
loo_predictive_interval(object, prob = 0.9,
psis_object = NULL, ...)
#### Arguments
object An object of class brmsfit.
type The statistic to be computed on the results. Can by either "mean" (default),
"var", or "quantile".
probs A vector of quantiles to compute. Only used if type = quantile.
psis_object An optional object returend by psis. If psis_object is missing then psis is
executed internally, which may be time consuming for models fit to very large
datasets.
* `` resp``: Optional names of response variables. If specified, predictions are performed
only for the specified response variables.
... Optional #### Arguments passed to the underlying methods that is log_lik, as well
as predict or fitted.
scale Passed to fitted.
prob For loo_predictive_interval, a scalar in (0; 1) indicating the desired probability
mass to include in the intervals. The default is prob = 0.9 (90% intervals).
#### Value
loo_predict and loo_linpred return a vector with one element per observation. The only exception
is if type = "quantile" and length(probs) >= 2, in which case a separate vector for each
92 loo_R2.brmsfit
element of probs is computed and they are returned in a matrix with length(probs) rows and one
column per observation.
loo_predictive_interval returns a matrix with one row per observation and two columns. loo_predictive_interval(..., is equivalent to loo_predict(..., type = "quantile", probs = c(a, 1-a)) with a = (1 - p)/2,
except it transposes the result and adds informative column names.

make_stancode Stan Code for brms Models
#### Description 
Generate Stan code for brms models
Usage
make_stancode(formula, data, family = gaussian(), prior = NULL,
autocor = NULL, cov_ranef = NULL, sparse = FALSE,
sample_prior = c("no", "yes", "only"), stanvars = NULL,
stan_funs = NULL, save_model = NULL, silent = FALSE, ...)
#### Arguments
formula An object of class formula, brmsformula, or mvbrmsformula (or one that can
be coerced to that classes): A symbolic #### Description  of the model to be fitted.
The #### Details of model specification are explained in brmsformula.
data An object of class data.frame (or one that can be coerced to that class) containing
data of all variables used in the model.
* `` family`` A description  of the response distribution and link function to be used in the
model. This can be a family function, a call to a family function or a character
string naming the family. Every family function has a link argument allowing to
specify the link function to be applied on the response variable. If not specified,
default links are used. For #### Details of supported families see brmsfamily. By
default, a linear gaussian model is applied. In multivariate models, family
might also be a list of families.
* ``prior``: One or more brmsprior objects created by set_prior or related functions and
combined using the c method or the + operator. See also get_prior for more
help.
* ``autocor`` An optional cor_brms object describing the correlation structure within the response
variable (i.e., the â€™autocorrelationâ€™). See the documentation of cor_brms
for a #### Description  of the available correlation structures. Defaults to NULL, corresponding
to no correlations. In multivariate models, autocor might also be a
list of autocorrelation structures.
* ``cov_ranef`` A list of matrices that are proportional to the (within) covariance structure of the
group-level effects. The names of the matrices should correspond to columns in
data that are used as grouping factors. All levels of the grouping factor should
appear as rownames of the corresponding matrix. This argument can be used,
among others to model pedigrees and phylogenetic effects. See vignette("brms_phylogenetics")
for more details.
make_standata 95
sparse Logical; indicates whether the population-level design matrices should be treated
as sparse (defaults to FALSE). For design matrices with many zeros, this can considerably
reduce required memory. Sampling speed is currently not improved or
even slightly decreased.
* ``sample_prior``: Indicate if samples from all specified proper priors should be drawn additionally
to the posterior samples (defaults to "no"). Among others, these samples can be
used to calculate Bayes factors for point hypotheses via hypothesis. If set to
"only", samples are drawn solely from the priors ignoring the likelihood, which
allows among others to generate samples from the prior predictive distribution.
In this case, all parameters must have proper priors.
stanvars An optional stanvars object generated by function stanvar to define additional
variables for use in Stanâ€™s program blocks.
stan_funs (Deprecated) An optional character string containing self-defined Stan functions,
which will be included in the functions block of the generated Stan code.
It is now recommended to use the stanvars argument for this purpose, instead.
save_model Either NULL or a character string. In the latter case, the modelâ€™s Stan code is
saved via cat in a text file named after the string supplied in save_model.
silent logical; If TRUE, warnings of the Stan parser will be suppressed.
... Other #### Arguments for internal usage only
#### Value
A character string containing the fully commented Stan code to fit a brms model.
Examples
make_stancode(rating ~ treat + period + carry + (1|subject),
data = inhaler, family = "cumulative")
make_stancode(count ~ log_Age_c + log_Base4_c * Trt_c
+ (1|patient) + (1|visit),
data = epilepsy, family = "poisson")
