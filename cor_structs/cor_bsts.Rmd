cor_bsts Basic Bayesian Structural Time Series
#### Description 
Add a basic Bayesian structural time series component to a brms model

### Usage
<pre><code>
cor_bsts(formula = ~1)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* formula A one sided formula of the form ~ t, or ~ t | g, specifying a time covariate
t and, optionally, a grouping factor g. A covariate for this correlation structure
must be integer #### Valued. When a grouping factor is present in formula, the correlation structure is assumed to apply only to observations within the same grouping level; observations with different grouping levels are assumed to be
uncorrelated. Defaults to ~ 1, which corresponds to using the order of the observations in the data as a covariate, and no groups.

#### Details

Bayesian structural time series models offer an alternative to classical AR(I)MA models (they are
in fact a generalization). The basic version currently implemented in brms introduces local level
terms for each observation, whereas each local level term depends on the former local level term:
LLt N(LLtô€€€1; sigmaLL)

A simple introduction can be found in this blogpost: http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/
blog/2016/04/21/forget-arima/. More complicated Bayesian structural time series models
may follow in the future.

#### Value
An object of class cor_bsts.

#### Examples
## Not run:
dat <- data.frame(y = rnorm(100), x = rnorm(100))
fit <- brm(y~x, data = dat, autocor = cor_bsts())
## End(Not run)
