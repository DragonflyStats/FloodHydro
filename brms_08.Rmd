fixef.brmsfit Extract Population-Level Estimates
#### Description 
Extract the population-level (’fixed’) effects from a brmsfit object.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
## S3 method for class 'brmsfit'
fixef(object, summary = TRUE, robust = FALSE,
probs = c(0.025, 0.975), pars = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>
#### Arguments

object An object of class brmsfit.
summary Should summary statistics (i.e. means, sds, and 95% intervals) be returned instead
of the raw values? Default is TRUE.
robust If FALSE (the default) the mean is used as the measure of central tendency and
the standard deviation as the measure of variability. If TRUE, the median and the
median absolute deviation (MAD) are applied instead. Only used if summary is
TRUE.
Frechet 63
probs The percentiles to be computed by the quantile function. Only used if summary
is TRUE.
pars Optional names of coefficients to extract. By default, all coefficients are extracted.
... Currently ignored.
value
If summary is TRUE, a matrix with one row per population-level effect and one column per calculated
estimate. If summary is FALSE, a matrix with one row per posterior sample and one column per
population-level effect.

#### Examples 
```{r}
## Not run:
fit <- brm(time | cens(censored) ~ age + sex + disease,
data = kidney, family = "exponential")
fixef(fit)
# extract only some coefficients
fixef(fit, pars = c("age", "sex"))
## End(Not run)
